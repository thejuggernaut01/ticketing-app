# whenever request comes in to nginx, it's going to attempt to match the path of that incoming request to the path we listed out in order.

# /?(.*) - this is a catch-all regex
# so we want to make sure that we always first list out our very particular APIs for our different services.

# And then only if we do not capture a request any of these different services do we want it to be eventually forwarded on to the client service.

# we always list our the client service at the very bottom,
# if we listed it at the top, then any incoming request would always be matched against it
